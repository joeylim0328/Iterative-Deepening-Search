# Iterative-Deepening-Search
Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) is a combination of Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS). IDS joins DFS's space-productivity and BFS's quick search. IDS calls DFS for different depths starting from an initial value, then BFS is performed to check if the newly visited nodes are the goal nodes.
